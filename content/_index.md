Hi, I'm Thiên Trang 👋 You can call me Trang 🩵

I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at [**Carnegie Mellon University**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [**Tim Dettmers**](https://timdettmers.com/about/). Previously, I worked at [**Qualcomm**](https://www.qualcomm.com) and was a Research Resident at [**VinAI Research**](https://vinai.io).

I'm currently poking around coding agents. Before that, I spent time on continual learning, backdoor attacks, and MoE -- stuff that still sneaks into how I think about problems today. I've also dabbled in optimal transport and model fusion.

I’m always happy to chat about any of this -- or honestly anything fun!

I also really love drawing -- it's been a big part of my life forever!
