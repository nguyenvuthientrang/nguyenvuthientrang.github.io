Hi, I'm Trang! 👋

I am a Ph.D. student 🎓 in empirical barkology at Woof University where I work in the lab of Prof. Bark Twain 🏛️

Most of my research is driven by trying to find an answer to the age-old question of "Who is a good boy?" 🐶❓

In my free time, I like running 🐕💨, playing frisbee 🥏 and trying new foods! 🍖

Please feel free to get in touch! 📬
