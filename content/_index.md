Hi, I'm Thiên Trang 👋 You can call me Trang 🍒

I'm currently a PhD student in Computer Science at [**Carnegie Mellon University**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [**Tim Dettmers**](https://timdettmers.com/about/). Previously, I worked at [**Qualcomm**](https://www.qualcomm.com) and was a Research Resident at [**VinAI Research**](https://vinai.io) under the guidance of [**Prof. Nhat Ho**](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io).

My research focuses on advancing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with two main goals: making them **Scalable & Efficient** ⬆, and ensuring they are **Safe, Private & Trustworthy** 🔐

I’ve explored exciting topics such as **Mixture of Experts** for scaling AI models and **Backdoor Attacks** to address critical security challenges. Additionally, I’ve worked on **Continual Learning**, **Optimal Transport**, and **Model Fusion**. I’m always curious and eager to learn about new ideas and explore diverse topics!
