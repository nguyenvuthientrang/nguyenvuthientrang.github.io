Hi, I'm Thiên Trang 👋 You can call me Trang 🍒

I'm currently a Research Resident 🤖 at [**VinAI Research**](https://vinai.io), where I have the privilege of working under the guidance of [**Prof. Nhat Ho**](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io) 🏛️

My research focuses on advancing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with two main goals: making them **Scalable & Efficient** ⬆, and ensuring they are **Safe, Private & Trustworthy** 🔐

I’ve explored exciting topics such as **Mixture of Experts** for scaling AI models and **Backdoor Attacks** to address critical security challenges. Additionally, I’ve worked on **Continual Learning**, **Optimal Transport**, and **Model Fusion**. I’m always curious and eager to learn about new ideas and explore diverse topics!

> I’m actively seeking PhD positions in Computer Science for the upcoming academic year 🔍
